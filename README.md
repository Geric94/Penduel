You don't need to install (Core) the Avalanche Wallet, Metamask also works.

It is delivered with an example of a contract, a test for this contract and a script which deploys this contract.
goto: https://github.com/Geric94/Penduel/blob/master/web3/README.md

and a client.
goto: https://github.com/Geric94/Penduel/blob/master/client/README.md

This contract uses the Fuji Tesnet avalanche but you can use yours.

You have to install this before:
